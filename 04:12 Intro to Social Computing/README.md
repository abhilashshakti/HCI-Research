What still matters about Distance? -- ⅗

This paper is an extension of the Oslon and Oslon (2000) paper which tries to convince the readers why the concept of “Distance” which was introduced a decade ago is still relevant. Diversity is the key to any successful organization and achieving it without distributed teams is nearly impossible. I agree with what the authors are trying to prove. The development of social computing is exciting. Things started with emails, moved to group chats, then teleconferences and webinars to now meetings supported by virtual reality. However, the fundamental challenges and social barriers that the participants faced back then, exits even now.

I can closely relate myself with this theory, especially when I look back at the time when I was working for Samsung Research, India. To support the Samsung Galaxy S8 release, I was located in South Korea for three months. This was a Hub and Spoke model, where my team was located in Bangalore. The major challenges I faced were from “time-zones” and “work-culture” perspectives. The time difference between the two countries is 3.5 hrs. While my co-workers in Korea would arrive in office at 8 AM (Korean Standard Time), my team members in India would arrive at 11 AM (Indian Standard Time). Thus, time difference effectively became 6.5 hours! So, during the initial few days, I would arrive in office at 8 AM and leave at 11 PM (this was only 7:30 PM back in India, and working till late evening is a norm in Indian tech companies). Things improved later as parties on both sides identified this problem. I had also figured out some hacks for overcoming this problem, which I’ll not discuss :)

Which team topology do you think is the best for geographically dispersed teams? Explain. (which team topology do you think is the worst)
I think that the hub 2-2 is the best topology because the problem of distant teams somewhat gets diluted (although not fully solved). The 2-2 kind of distribution would give teams on both sides the opportunity to indulge in both virtual and real meetings.
I might be biased on this but I feel hub and spoke 3-1 is the worst topology. This is because the satellite person is helpless and suffers because the majority is on the other side (personal experience as discussed above).

Trust Breaks Down in Electronic Contexts but Can be Repaired by Some Initial Face-to-Face Contact -- ⅘

There are a few things technology can’t improve, “trust” is one of those. I am glad that a paper published way back in 1998 is part of our readings, as the findings still hold true. In modern corporate setups, where F-t-F meetings are becoming less frequent, and employees preferring to work from home, this paper is an eye-opener. Even the most advanced messengers like Slack, fail to nurture trust within the team, especially for new joinees. This is an excellent reading for all modern day corporate managers.

Putting Your Team First, and Yourself Second: In condition-III, the subjects lived by this philosophy and it worked wonderfully for them. This attitude showed in their conversation, strategy making and actions. In successful teams, individual payoffs are rather bi-products of the attempt to maximize group payoffs. This holds true in sports, film-making or any other team activity.

I wish the author had elaborated more on how well the participants understood this activity before indulging in the experiment. This activity has the objectives of maximizing individual gains with group gains acting as constraints. This is something not easy to understand (resembles BlackJack to some extent). Probably, a few trial sessions with the computer could have made the rules clearer and thus making the experiment less error prone.

Lastly, I wanted to see an elaborate discussion on the emergence of “Group Leaders”. We know that effective leaders can elevate chaotic teams to becoming the best ones. Had strong leaders emerged in condition-II, the outcomes could have been different. One of the qualities of good leaders is that they possess strong communication skills, which should be effective even with an electronic form of communication.

Video-based communication is definitely a more effective form of communication (compared to text-based communication). One reason is that the listener has to focus on only one speaker at a time, instead of gazing through a stream of messages from multiple group members flowing in simultaneously. Trust breakdown may still occur video-based communication is usually limited to viewing faces of speakers. Body language and gestures are also important eg: hand-shakes instantly induce warmness before the conversation.
