	RESEARCH METHODS AS OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITATIONS -- ⅘

I liked the way this chapter this presented. For someone reading this chapter alone (and the entire book) would have no difficulties in understanding the references (of previous and next chapters). Also, the language is easy to understand and all the hypotheses are backed by relevant examples (moving from more abstract ones to the more real-life scenarios which are relevant till date). The author does not limit himself to just explaining the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, instead he encourages the readers and possible experimenters to leverage the strengths of each method in devising the best strategy with resources in hand.

I liked the idea of dividing different techniques by modeling them into a quadrant (although, there are typing errors in pointing to the axes), and named strategy circumplex). I would have loved to read more about author’s thought process while coming up with this quadrant model. The author fails to answer questions relating to the “necessity” and “sufficiency” of the three criteria depicted and also the subdivision into 8 sub-areas.

Since, the author proposes three criteria (generalizability, precision and realism) as the basis for evaluation of any research method. Does this not imply that the quadrant can be better depicted in three dimensions rather than in two dimensions? I find the use of “obtrusiveness” and “abstraction” as axes little vague and unnecessary, given we already have three independent criteria which lead to better representation.

I wish the author had elaborated more on trace measures in terms of “data privacy”. Trace measure is a common and effective process of collecting user logs, browsing history and personal information. With the recent events of data breach (Facebook), it is important that user are made aware of exactly what information is being collected. So, the analysis of user behavior in trace measure may not be absolutely natural anymore (in context of this paper).

Given any 2 papers we have read in class, which section(s) of figure 2 would each paper satisfy? Justify your reasoning.
The paper on Parallel Prototyping (Steven Dow et al.) is a “Laboratory Experiment”, where the participants (designers) were asked to be present in Stanford lab for a comparative study on serial and parallel prototyping. The paper on Foldit (Seth Coper et al.) is an example of “Experimental Simulation” where the players get to interact with simulated protein structures which resemble closely to the actual protein structures.

PROTOTYPING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES -- ⅘

This chapter is huge! I felt like reading a Wikipedia article on prototyping tools and techniques. I liked the way authors introduced the concept of prototyping by throwing light on representation, precision and interactivity aspects before diving into each prototyping techniques (rapid prototyping, iterative prototyping and evolutionary prototyping). Very often authors tend to ignore the introducing and defining the topic. But giving a broad view of the theme sets the tone and engages the user before diving deep into the detailed description.

It’s needless to point out how detailed this study is. It starts with paper prototyping and goes all the way up to Extreme Programming! However, it does not discuss the ideas of serial and parallel prototyping. I might be biased on this (having presented this idea in the last class) but these are important concepts of prototyping and can significantly alter the final outcomes (which is the goal of any prototyping technique).

This is one of those rare papers where the authors don't shy away from explaining the software architectures, libraries and frameworks. I feel it is important for designers to be good software engineers as well. For me the two areas (software engineering and designing) are inseparable. I loved the way authors have discussed “Design Patterns”, particularly MVC and Gang of Four design patterns. Designers often tend to believe that implementing the design is not their responsibility and they outsource or off-load the work. This can be catastrophic in case of iterative and evolutionary prototyping). Although some of the examples given in the study are outdated (eg: Macromedia Explorer and Action Scripts are rarely used these days), the context is still very relevant.

What prototyping tools and techniques from this paper will you utilize in your project and what is the reasoning for choosing them?
We are actually trying to build a prototyping assistant system for designers. So, we’ll be using prototyping to help improve prototyping! For our project, I am planning to use iterative prototyping, (which can be also seen as evolutionary prototyping in some sense) due to time constraints (just 6 weeks for implementation). Since, this is going to be a software application, the use of paper prototyping and other low-fidelity prototyping techniques is minimal.
Also, I shall be using Wizard of Oz technique to study user behavior and analyzing user needs during the initial phase of the project.
