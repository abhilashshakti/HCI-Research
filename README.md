# HCI-Research
I was enrolled in the course [Interaction Design Research](https://d.ucsd.edu/IxD/research/2018) with [Scott Klemmer](https://d.ucsd.edu/srk/) in Spring 2018 at UCSD.  
This course lays emphasis on reading, critiquing and presenting papers in every class (in addition to a quarter long project).
