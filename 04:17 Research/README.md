The Science of Design -- ⅗

The author presents an extensive account of what how design is perceived in that era (around 1969) and how the approach towards design, especially “Design Curriculum” should be changed. Although, the chapter draws analogies to artificial/professional science (engineering and business) and natural sciences (physics, biology, psychology), I liked the way how examples are drawn from other disciplines such as architecture, music and even gaming to simply the explanation. This makes the reading appealing and reaches a wider audience.

The use of footer notes is brilliant! The author has not limited himself to simply using the footers for references, but has gone ahead and shared real-life incidents and stories. I especially liked the one where he explains the word “unnecessary” (with respect to introducing special logic) and then takes a dig at logicians who fail to understand the difference between non-necessity and impossibility.

I wish there was use of mathematical equations, graphs and plots to explain scientific theories. Although, it is often difficult for the reader from non-scientific backgrounds to grasp equations, equations are an efficient way to convey ideas systematically and precisely. Theories of Optimization, Travelling Salesman Problem and Minmax algorithm would have made more sense when described with equations or graphs.

If you notice carefully, the author has used a bottom-up approach for his hypothesis on curriculum design. The section “Topics in Theory of Design” actually summarize the building blocks of the curriculum. I would have preferred to introduce this section right in the beginning of the chapter (similar to Abstract in a paper). It helps in two ways: One, set the agenda right in the beginning and letting the readers know what to expect. Two, the reader does not get lost while reading the chapter, since the roadmap was already introduced in the beginning. There are no sudden revelations at different times.

Satisficing is the decision method of looking for good or satisfactory solutions instead of optimal ones. Satisficing can be used in stock market analysis for making the decision of buying, selling or holding a stock. We don’t really need to know the exact value by which the the stock price would rise/fall to make the decision. Just knowing the direction of change (rise or fall) would suffice. Satisficing is not appropriate for space shuttle experiments, such as rocket launches. Difference of split second can prove catastrophic. We need exact measurements and solutions in this case.

Transforming the Paradigm -- ⅖

Author uses an intelligent way to compare the representation of research in a one-dimension vs representation of research in a multi-dimensional spectrum. By taking the example of Pasteur’s research author effectively convey that although the equations: (+1) + (-1) = 0 and (0) + (0) = 0, they essentially  convey two very different theories (here the two inputs represent the weights for Basic and Applied Research). Therefore, Basic Research does not compensate or dilute Applied Research and vice versa.

I would have liked to see more frequent use of dates while conveying the historical advancements. I don’t have in-depth knowledge of American history. So, it becomes difficult for readers like me to understand the chronological sequence of historical events. The author uses names of different Presidents, leaders and philosophers to put forward theories of differentiation in research (pure, applied, oriented etc) at different times of modern era. It would have been great if he had tagged specific years to go with them.

This reading is a chapter from a book. Good books have chapter divided into sections and subsections. However, this chapter hardly has any subsections! The section on “Official Reporting Categories” is printed on pg:64-70. But this does not have any subsections. Although, we see transitions made during the explanation (pg: 68, shifting from goals of research to the intended users of research) the reader has to work hard understanding this transition in the absence of structural clues.

I believe dividing research into different categories is extremely difficult. The author has primarily discussed breaking research into broad categories such as fundamental research, oriented research and applied research. However, sometimes we may have to break it into finer categories. I remember while submitting a paper to the International Conference of Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE) 2016, the organizing body (IEEE) required the submitter to provide the nearest category for the research. My research was part of V2V communication, signal processing and roadblock detection. I found it really difficult to decide which is the best category for the research (and how should I decide that). This decision has a direct outcome on who evaluates the papers and how the paper is perceived. I am sure this is a problem frequently faced by researchers.

By using a 2-D conceptual plane, the author is implying not one but dual dichotomies. Therefore, it is not fair to represent Basic and Applied research on the same dimension (along the x-axis) because Pasteur is a function of 2 variables (both Basic and Applied research). So, dividing the quadrant into four pockets would mean removing the comparison between the Basic and Applied research and focussing on the underlying principles (fundamental research and consideration of use).
